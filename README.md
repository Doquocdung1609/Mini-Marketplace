# 🛒 Decentralized Marketplace On-Chain

## 📜 Project Description

This project is a decentralized, on-chain **marketplace** built using the Clarity smart contract language and deployed on the **Stacks blockchain (Testnet)**. It allows users to **list, buy, and sell products** in a trustless, peer-to-peer environment without the need for intermediaries.

All product data, ownership, pricing, and transaction logic are securely handled by the smart contract. Buyers and sellers interact transparently, and funds are automatically transferred upon successful purchases.

## 🔭 Project Vision

The vision behind this project is to **enable open, decentralized commerce** where trust is built into the code, not dependent on centralized platforms. Key goals include:

* Demonstrating how blockchain can support real-world commerce use cases.
* Providing a transparent and censorship-resistant platform for digital or physical goods.
* Encouraging the adoption of Clarity smart contracts and the Stacks ecosystem for marketplace dApps.
